Our model is based on psychological theories and used to measure personality. This model provides a summary of the overall personality of the person. We would be focusing on categorizing people as shy, introvert or bold or extrovert. The data would be trained in accordance to how a person types, we will be picking up tweets from the internet and the style of writing to determine the personality of the person. The idea was inspired by an already existing Ocean model that categorizes 5 different personality traits.
